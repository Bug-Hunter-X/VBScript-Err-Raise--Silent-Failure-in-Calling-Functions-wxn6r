This repository demonstrates a subtle error handling problem in VBScript. The `bug.vbs` file shows a function that raises an error if its parameter is empty. However, the calling code lacks a mechanism to catch and handle this error, resulting in a silent failure. The `bugSolution.vbs` file presents a corrected version that properly handles the potential error using On Error Resume Next and checking Err.Number.
